## 3. Scripts Description

code/Generate_hyp_feature_RDMs.ipynb
> To generate all hypthesis-based feature RDMs.

code/Behavioral_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb
> Behavioral analyses on pre-task 3 (Cube Adjustment Task) and visualization of individual results.

code/EEG_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb
> RSA analyses based on EEG signals and visualizations of key results.

code/fMRI_analysis_and_visualization.ipynb
> RSA analyses based on fMRI signals and visualizations of key results. (*We didn't include all the codes for geometric distance representations, ROI-based analyses, and permutation analyses - which are highly similar to the code you will find in this file.)

## 4. Notes on data processing

Functional MRI data were transformed from **Talairach (TAL)** space to **MNI152** space using **ANTs (Advanced Normalization Tools)**.

The MNI-aligned fMRI data were projected to the **fsaverage** cortical surface using **FreeSurfer**.

For the surface-based results, we used **pycortex** and **nilearn** to perform the visualizations.
